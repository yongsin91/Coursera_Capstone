Summary

There are many factors that can make or break a restaurant, location is definitely one of them. It is a fantasy for entrepreneurs to have their restaurant at the prime location where one never need to fret over the lack of customers. Nevertheless, in reality there are only so much prime location in an area, which therefore came the term "prime". Although there are many aspects that constitutes a good location, one cannot neglect the fact that an unsuitable location will cause unnecessary loss, and in worse case scenario causing the restaurant unsustainable. This project aim to solve part of the puzzle to provide a good estimate of a good location through the usage of existing restaurant distribution and existing population distribution.
